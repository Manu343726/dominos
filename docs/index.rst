Welcome to Dominos API's documentation!
---------------------------------------

These are the docs for the unofficial API for dominos.co.uk. A project
made out of curiosity and fun, it lets you order pizza and sides
from your commandline. A work in progress.

DISCLAIMER
----------

The whole thing was written for fun and as a learning exercise. This is not
an official API for the dominos.co.uk website and is in no way supported,
endorsed by, or affiliated with Dominos.
The author of this API does not accept any liability or blame for
any misplaced orders, incorrect delivery details, incorrect charges or
other issues that might occur when using this API.
So don't come knocking if you accidentally ordered 100 pepperoni pizzas.
