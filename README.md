Dominos Python API
==================

Order dominos.co.uk pizza from your commandline.

Requirements
============
beautifulsoup4
requests

Disclaimer
==========

Not all details have been thoroughly tested, so use with care. Payment is
cash on delivery only and this works for .co.uk only.

This is barely alpha, the submission for payment hasn't been tested yet
(I don't order enough pizza) but that day will come.
If you want to test it, comment out the return statement in the function.

But use with care until this library can be considered stable.

If you writing some code and ordering a pizza, why not do so and help me out?

Info
====

Docs are in `docs` and can be built with Sphinx - `make html` 

The `order.py` is a test implementation of a CLI for the API. Useful for testing
and as a reference to how the API can be used.
